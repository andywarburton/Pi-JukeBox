# Pi-JukeBox
A simple MP3 player for my Raspberry Pi

This is a personal project to play random MP3 files from a directory using a python script with simple button controls via GPIO. The _working file does work at the moment but is kinda Janky. Obviously no MP3 files are included because copyright is a pain in the bum.

nb... totally not a python dev. This is hacked together like you would never believe. Feel free to suggest improvements :)
